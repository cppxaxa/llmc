Here is the modified content for the file `\promptmodifier-test\README.md` after replacing the `<TODO>` with the user query without presets:

```markdown
# Original user query
Tell me ad clicks for China and US market from PCT and it should be Shopping ad

# Presets to remove from user query
- PCT filter
- US market filter


# User query without presets
```plaintext
Tell me ad clicks for China and Shopping ad
```
```

This modification retains all relevant information while addressing the TODO as requested.
